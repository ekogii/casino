# Casino
### By Ethan Kemp (ekogii)

This is my casino, and it is just an extremely basic (for now) CLI that I made for all my friends with a gambling addiction, myself *[excluded](./exclude.md)*.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release of the source code (found in the *Releases* tab)
2. Extract it. This varies depending on whether you downloaded the .tar.gz or the .zip
3. CD into the place you downloaded the code, and run the following command:
```
make && sudo make install
```
> Note:
*If you wish to only install my casino locally (inside your home directory), instead you should run `make && make -s install-local`*

And you are done with the installation!
